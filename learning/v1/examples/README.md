# Learning Domain – Example Payloads

This directory contains example request/response payloads for each Beckn 2.0 flow, using the learning domain schema extension (`opun:learning`).

All examples use:
- `context.domain`: `opun:learning`
- `@context`: [Beckn Core v2 context, Learning v1 context]

## Payloads

## Enrollment Lifecycle

The examples demonstrate the complete enrollment lifecycle:

1. **Search** → Find courses
2. **Select** → View course details and enrollment form
3. **Init** → Submit enrollment form
4. **Confirm** → Enrollment confirmed (`pending` → `confirmed`, `applied` → `enrolled`)
5. **Status** → Track progress (`in_progress`, progress percentage)
6. **Update** → Progress updates, certificate issued (`completed`, certificate details)
7. **Cancel** → Cancel enrollment if needed (`cancelled`)
